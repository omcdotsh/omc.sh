_Last week, I closed one chapter and opened another: I resigned from 🦋 Morpho Labs to join 🍀 Neutrl Labs. It’s been a wild ride getting here, so here’s a bit of omc.sh lore — how boredom, curiosity, and a willingness to leap into the unknown shaped my path to the EVM ecosystem and beyond._

## From Logos to Code: The Early Days

In high school, I found myself stifled by the classroom. To scratch the itch, I taught myself the Adobe Suite—Photoshop, Illustrator, the whole shebang—and started selling logos and web designs on the esports market via Twitter. It was my first taste of building something real and earning real dollars from it.

But lurking behind those early gigs was a deeper itch: I was tired of the endless economics and finance theories that dominated my college courses. After discovering Bitcoin and Ethereum, I realized the true opportunities lay in mastering code and IT systems. So I took a bold step: I dropped out of top 🇫🇷 universities and dove headfirst into programming.

## Grinding at École 42

Determined to level up my skills, I passed the École 42 entry exam, where I learned C and C++. I hustled—literally—distributing flyers in the streets for pennies, all while grinding late nights to become an on‑chain smith. Coffee-fueled, code-filled nights were my new normal.

Then, in 2022, I forged my first true Web3 blade: a decentralized escrow solution for freelancers, which won a cash prize at the [0xpolygon](https://x.com/0xPolygon) hackathon. That moment cemented my belief that decentralized systems could unlock entirely new paradigms of work and value exchange.

## Riding the Waves: From Web2 to Web3

I briefly took a web2 software engineering role, soaking up best practices and scaling lessons. Eight months in, though, I felt the pull of Web3 too strong to ignore. I quit and joined [FydeLabs](https://x.com/fydelabs) as a freelancer - loads of people thought I was crazy for giving up a stable paycheck and benefits.

Not long after, I joined [Morpho Labs](https://x.com/morpholabs). There, I built some of the sickest features I’ve ever tackled: seamless position migrations between protocols, refinancing positions across Morpho markets, and more. But again, comfort felt like chains, and I decided to walk away - despite everyone telling me, “Why leave such runway?”

## The Mentors in the Shadows

Throughout every twist and turn, I’ve been guided by mentors you’ll never see in the spotlight. To them, I owe every skill I wield today. The secret? Never hold back a question. **Ask. Learn. Build.** That’s my battle cry against _boredom_ and _stagnation_.

## Onward to Neutrl Labs

And now: 🍀 [Neutrl Labs](https://x.com/neutrl_labs). What the heck is Neutrl? It’s a market‑neutral synthetic dollar designed to unlock untapped yield opportunities in OTC and altcoin markets. By leveraging OTC arbitrage, funding‑rate inefficiencies, and DeFi‑native market‑neutral strategies, Neutrl provides a single, high‑yield access point for capital allocators.

Legends aren’t born in comfort zones. When most saw safety, I saw chains to break. So here I go again — **ask, learn, build.**
